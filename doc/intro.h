 * @mainpage RETHINK C --- C Algorithms Library
 * 
 * @section Introduction
 * 
 * Relearn and rethink C Programming Language, including some of data structures and algorithms.
 * 
 * Some of the code inspired (copied) by Simon Howard's [c-algorithms](https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms), like ArrayList, etc. This project also reused his alloc-testing framework for memory testing.
 * 
 * RETHINK-C aims to build a reuseable codebase for C Programming Language. 
 *
